# #100DaysOfDesignAndCode Log | Round 2 | [Ashish Bardhan]

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [May 28, Monday, 2024].

### Day 0 (Prerequisites): May 26, 2024 (Sunday)

**Today's Progress**: I have 2 main learning routes: Dev & Design. Most of the time, they overlap due to my experience in UI/UX & other creative fields. But sometimes, there are things in either route that I've been studying separately.

**Thoughts**: Time to track all of them productively.

### Day 1: May 27, 2024 (Monday)

**Today's Progress**:

1. Started learning more about `Web Accessibility` (a11y in short) from `IxDF` and `web.dev` course materials.
2. Started working on my `React` assignment.
3. Started logging my dev-design progress on this repo.

**Thoughts**: Although, I am familiar with both `a11y` and `React` programming. But I want to gain some expertise knowledge in a11y from certified sources and brush my skills in `React` programming by working on this assignment project.

### Day 2: May 31, 2024 (Friday)

**Today's Progress**:

1. Finally, I've completed my `React` assignment after coding for almost whole week.
2. Continue learning more about `a11y`from `IxDF` and `web.dev` course materials.

**Thoughts**: It was nice experience working on this assignment | from brainstorming ideas to coding to debugging issues to final release to `Netlify` platform. It made me realise how much more I need to learn more about `React`. And luckily, I found out one free course which I start studying from next week. I seriously deserve a weekend break after reckless brainstorming and coding for this assignment.

### Day 3: June 1, 2024 (Saturday)

**Today's Progress**:

1. Finishing touches with some UI tweaks and code optimisation.
2. Update README document describing the features, the web performance reports and future improvements on this assignment.

**Thoughts**: Seems like I can't help myself programming during weekend. But it's alright! I've nothing else to do at home anyway as I can't go outside in extremely hot weather.

### Day 4: June 4, 2024 (Tuesday)

**Today's Progress**:

1. Started practising `React` with tutorials from @CalebCurry.
2. Understand the basics by developing a component with props and states in a small `React` app.

**Thoughts**: Luckily I got this free course after browsing on the Internet this past weekend. I am excited to learn more through these tutorials (100 video leactures to be precise).

### Day 5: June 6, 2024 (Thursday)

**Today's Progress**:

1. Continue practising `React` with tutorials from @CalebCurry.
2. Implement `Tailwind CSS` and `React Bootstrap` into this `React` app for styling and pre-defined components respectively.
3. Developed more functionalities into this app:
    - Display a list of items
    - Update a list item
    - Add a newly created list item

**Thoughts**: I've finished 15/100 video lectures so far.
