# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: June 24, 2017 (Saturday)

**Today's Progress**: Getting started with SVG.

**Thoughts**: I've been thinking about this for a long time. Just learning and pracitising the basics. I'm hoping to make some really awesome art using SVG in future. Perhaps coding CSS images is too mainstream for me now. :P
