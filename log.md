# #100DaysOfDesignAndCode Log - Round 2 - [Ashish Bardhan]

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [May 28, Monday, 2024].

### Day 0 (Prerequisites): May 26, 2024 (Sunday)

**Today's Progress**: I have 2 main learning routes: Dev & Design. Most of the time, they overlap due to my experience in UI/UX & other creative fields. But sometimes, there are things in either route that I've been studying separately.

**Thoughts**: Time to track all of them productively.

**Link(s) to work**: N/A

### Day 1: May 27, 2024 (Monday)

**Today's Progress**:
1. Started learning more about `Web Accessibility` (a11y in short) from `IxDF` and `web.dev` course materials.
2. Started working on my `React` assignment.
3. Started logging my dev-design progress on this repo.

**Thoughts**: Although, I am familiar with both a11y and React programming. But I want to gain some expertise knowledge in a11y from certified sources and brush my skills in React programming by working on this assignment project.
