# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: June 24, 2017 (Saturday)

**Today's Progress**: Getting started with SVG.

**Thoughts**: I've been thinking about this for a long time. Just learning and pracitising the basics. I'm hoping to make some really awesome art using SVG in future. Perhaps coding CSS images is too mainstream for me now. :P

### Day 2: June 25, 2017 (Sunday)

**Today's Progress**:
1. Learned SVG elements are their attributes
2. Created an image of "Peacock" in SVG at Codepen

**Thoughts**: Tutorials by Jenkov are more comprehrensive and really helpful for intermediate level coders. I had fun while coding in SVG, though it was challening at the beginning. But coding CSS images really helped me out here as I always have the appraoch of figuring out common patterns before jumping to code. And besides, it took me almost 2 hours to get those curves right. :P
