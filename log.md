# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: June 24, 2017 (Saturday)

**Today's Progress**: Getting started with SVG.

**Thoughts**: I've been thinking about this for a long time. Just learning and pracitising the basics. I'm hoping to make some really awesome art using SVG in future. Perhaps coding CSS images is too mainstream for me now. :P

### Day 2: June 25, 2017 (Sunday)

**Today's Progress**:
1. Learned SVG elements are their attributes
2. Created an image of "Peacock" in SVG at Codepen

**Thoughts**: Tutorials by Jenkov are more comprehrensive and really helpful for intermediate level coders. I had fun while coding in SVG, though it was challening at the beginning. But coding CSS images really helped me out here as I always have the appraoch of figuring out common patterns before jumping to code. And besides, it took me almost 2 hours to get those curves right. :P

### Day 3: June 26, 2017 (Monday)

**Today's Progress**:
1. Learned SVG animation
2. Added animations on the previously made "Peacock" SVG at Codepen

**Thoughts**: I always love to make animations in CSS. So I gave it a shot in SVG as well. It is interesting and bit challenging. But too many elements and attributes have to be put inside the code to make it work, especially on reusable elements with minor tweaks. I feel CSS animation is better and it's great in SCSS. I'll try to do that way tomorrow. Anyways, Eid Mubarak everybody! :)
