# #100DaysOfDesignAndCode Log | Round 2 | [Ashish Bardhan]

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [May 28, Monday, 2024].

### Day 0 (Prerequisites): May 26, 2024 (Sunday)

**Today's Progress**: I have 2 main learning routes: Dev & Design. Most of the time, they overlap due to my experience in UI/UX & other creative fields. But sometimes, there are things in either route that I've been studying separately.

**Thoughts**: Time to track all of them productively.

### Day 1: May 27, 2024 (Monday)

**Today's Progress**:

1. Started learning more about `Web Accessibility` (a11y in short) from `IxDF` and `web.dev` course materials.
2. Started working on my `React` assignment.
3. Started logging my dev-design progress on this repo.

**Thoughts**: Although, I am familiar with both `a11y` and `React` programming. But I want to gain some expertise knowledge in a11y from certified sources and brush my skills in `React` programming by working on this assignment project.

### Day 2: May 31, 2024 (Friday)

**Today's Progress**:

1. Finally, I've completed my `React` assignment after coding for almost whole week.
2. Continue learning more about `a11y`from `IxDF` and `web.dev` course materials.

**Thoughts**: It was nice experience working on this assignment | from brainstorming ideas to coding to debugging issues to final release to `Netlify` platform. It made me realise how much more I need to learn more about `React`. And luckily, I found out one free course which I start studying from next week. I seriously deserve a weekend break after reckless brainstorming and coding for this assignment.

**Today's Progress**:

1. Finishing touches with some UI tweaks and code optimisation.
2. Update README document describing the features, the web performance reports and future improvements on this assignment.

**Thoughts**: Seems like I can't help myself programming during weekend. But it's alright! I've nothing else to do at home anyway as I can't go outside in extremely hot weather.

1. Started practising `React` with tutorials from @CalebCurry.
2. Understand the basics by developing a component with props and states in a small `React` app.

1. Continue practising `React` with tutorials.
2. Implement `Tailwind CSS` and `React Bootstrap` into this `React` app for styling and pre-defined components respectively.

**Today's Progress**:

1. Continue practising `React` with tutorials.

### Day 7: June 9, 2024 (Sunday)

**Today's Progress**:

1. Continue practising `React` with tutorials.
2. Implemented a backend API service using `Django` framework and wrote down some `GET` request in `Python`.
3. Studied first module of `User Experience (UX)` course from `IxDf`, where I was able to understand about UX and essential skills required to be a UX designer.

**Thoughts**: Being a frontend developer, It's been ages since I've programmed anything in Python let alone working in its Django framework. I felt a bit overwhelemed working on this backend service, especially when I struggled during package installation and essential commands to run the entire application. However, the tutorials helped me understand the Django boilerplate and its environment much better. I might go deep dive in future when I'll be interested wroking as a fullstack developer.

I've finished 33/100 video lectures so far.

### Day 8: June 11, 2024 (Tuesday)

**Today's Progress**:

1. Continue practising `React` with tutorials.
2. Create a full `CRUD` API request at `Django` backend and intergrate with `React` frontend to render the results.

**Thoughts**: I've finished 40/100 video lectures so far.

### Day 9: June 13, 2024 (Thursday)

**Today's Progress**:

1. Studied third module of `Web A11y` course from `IxDF` and `web.dev`, where I was able to understand to code optimisation for website / mobile accessibility.
2. Practiced my `React` skills in `Frontend Development Libraries` certification course by `FreeCodeCamp`.

**Thoughts**: I struggled a little while coding their exercises in `Class Components` since I'm familiar with new `Functional Component` format adopted in modern `React` versions. But still I managed to complete all of the exercises as my fundamental concepts were clear despite a few change in syntax.

### Day 10: June 18, 2024 (Tuesday)

**Today's Progress**:

1. Studied second module of `User Experience (UX)` course from `IxDF`, where I was able to understand the elements of UX design and different approaches as a UX designer.

**Thoughts**: I skipped learning and coding for a few days as I was recovering from fever due to exteme heat.

1. Studied first module of `UX Portfolio` course from `IxDF`, where I was able to understand importance of a UX portfolio and Case Studies with common UX roles.

**Thoughts**: One of UX roles - UX Unicorn (a.k.a UX Engineer) is something I have my eyes on as I was working in that particular profile to some extent at my previous organisation. I want to explore and do more things in this line of work.
